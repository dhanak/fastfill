# FastFill Rust prototype

Experimental cross-platform rewrite. The production C#/WinUI application is
unchanged. See [PLAN.md](PLAN.md) for scope, progress, and checkpoint gates.

Install the pinned toolchain and run all local checks:

```sh
mise install
mise exec -- cargo fmt --check
mise exec -- cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings
mise exec -- cargo test --all-features
mise exec -- cargo check --target wasm32-unknown-unknown
```

The WASM command needs its standard library once per toolchain:

```sh
mise exec -- rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
```

Run the current native prototype:

```sh
mise exec -- cargo run
```

Serve the same prototype to another device on the LAN:

```sh
mise run web
```

Open the printed `http://<laptop-address>:24800/` URL. The device must be able
to reach TCP port 24800. Trunk watches for changes, but browser auto-reload is
disabled so the generated page never assumes the development machine is
`localhost`; refresh the browser after a rebuild.

Checkpoint 2 opens one bounded PNG/JPEG and supports Fit, 1:1, zoom buttons,
pointer-anchored mouse-wheel zoom, left/right-button panning, one-finger touch
panning, and two-finger pan/pinch zoom. It does not yet support annotations,
projects, or saving.
